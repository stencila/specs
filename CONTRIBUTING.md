## Overview

This file provides a guide for contributing to the Stencila Schema definitions and associated documentation. For tips on developing the programming language bindings please see the relevant README files for the language package.

For each type in this schema, there are two canonical files from which code and documentation is generated:

- `<type>.schema.yaml` is the JSON Schema, written in YAML, for the type.

- `<type>.md` documentation for the type including examples and a description of design considerations for the schema

## Writing `<type>.schema.yaml` files

The schema for a type is defined, using JSON Schema, in a `<type>.schema.yaml` file. We use YAML, which is a superset of JSON, because it is more readable than JSON.

See the excellent [Understanding JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/) for guides on writing a JSON Schema. The following sections describe the most important, and custom, keywords in the schema in the order that they normally appear.

### The `title` keyword

Each type schema MUST begin with the title of the type e.g.

```yaml
title: Organization
```

### The `@id` keyword

This is a custom keyword used to define a term with the vocabulary of the Stencila JSON-LD `@context`.

Where possible use terms from existing vocabularies. Currently, the Stencila context allows you to refer to the following external vocabularies:

- `schema`: https://schema.org/
- `bioschemas`: http://bioschemas.org
- `codemeta`: https://doi.org/10.5063/schema/codemeta-2.0

#### Type `@id`s

You MUST declare the `@id` keyword for each type using the format `<context>:<type>`. Note that because this property name begins with the special character `@`, that it needs to be surrounded by quotes e.g.

```yaml
'@id': schema:Person
```

Use existing type names from other vocabularies as much as possible. For example, the type schema to represent a laboratory protocol might use the `@id` of the Bioschemas [`LabProtocol`](http://bioschemas.org/specifications/LabProtocol/).

```yaml
'@id': bioschemas:LabProtocol
```

When a type is not represented in another vocabulary, or has a sufficiently different structure to a similar type elsewhere, define the id within the Stencila context i.e. `'@id': stencila:<type>`

#### Property `@id`s

You MUST declare the `@id` keyword for each property of a type using the format `<context>:<property>`.

Often, the `@id` will be the same as the property name. However, you should reuse property names from other vocabularies where possible. For example, the `Person` type schema has a property `givenNames` (not the plural) which is an array of strings.

```yaml
givenNames:
  '@id': schema:givenName
  type: array
  items: string
```

By declaring the `@id` of that property as `schema:givenName` we are saying "within this vocabulary, when we use the term 'givenNames', we mean the same as http://schema.org/givenName".

Sometimes, a property name is not represented in another vocabulary. In these casese, define the property name as a new term within the Stencila vocabulary i.e. `'@id': stencila:<property>`

### The `extends` keyword

This is a custom keyword which allows your type schema to inherit the `properties` and `required` keywords of a parent type schema. It should be the name of another type e.g.

```yaml
extends: Entity
```

### The `role` keyword

A recommended custom keyword to indicate the role of the type schema:

- `base`: base types, not usually instantiated but required for other types e.g `Entity` or `Thing`
- `primary`: types that are usually the root of a tree generated from a file e.g. `Article`, `Datatable`, `Collection`
- `secondary`: types usually only referred to by primary types e.g. `Organization` is used for the `publisher` property on a `Article`
- `tertiary`: types usually only referred to by secondary types e.g. `ContactPoint` is used for the `contactPoints` property on an `Organization`

### The `status` keyword

A recommended custom keyword to indicate the development status of a type schema e.g.

- `experimental`: extension types (i.e. not defined on schema.org or elsewhere) that are still under development and for which the likelihood of breaking changes is relatively high
- `unstable`: types that are defined elsewhere (e.g. on http://bioschemas.org) but for which the schema definition is still being developed; breaking changes are possible but less likely than `experimental` types
- `stable`: types for which the schema definition can be considered stable and breaking changes unlikely.

If a type schema is marked as `experimental` it will not be published as being part of the schema. This is to avoid breaking changes, and thus new major version numbers, to the schema as a whole.

When a type is promoted from `experimental` to `unstable` or `stable`, the change should be associated with a `feat` commit to increment the minor version number.

Expansion of type schemas with new properties and other non-breaking changes is allowed. Renaming or removal of schema classes or any of their properties is considered a breaking change and should be done with careful consideration. If any such changes need to be made,they must first be marked as deprecated but not removed. Once a major version is to be released, properties and helpers marked as deprecated should be removed all at once.

### The `description` keyword

You must add a description for all types and properties. Descriptions must be plain text and less than 120 characters. We apply this rule so that descriptions can be rendered in a variety on contexts including documentation strings in a variety of languages. If you need to add more details, or want to use Markdown, put it in the `$comment` property.

### The `aliases` keyword

A custom keyword which allows you to define aliases for properties. For example,

```yaml
properties:
  ...
  familyNames:
    '@id': schema:familyName
    aliases:
      - familyName
      - surname
      - surnames
      - lastName
      - lastNames
```

### The `codec` keyword

A custom keyword which allow you to define allowable shorthand strings for a property or types. The value of the keyword is the name of a codec to use. Parsers always take a string but differ in the type that they produce, for example:

- `ssi`: decodes a space separated list of items to an array of strings
- `csi`: decodes a comma separated list of items to an array of strings
- `person`: decodes a personal name, email or url to a `Person`

You can specify a codec for both types and properties. To specify a codec for a type, add the `codec` keyword at the top level e.g.

```yaml
title: Person
---
codec: person
```

You can specify a codec for a property using `anyOf`. For example, to allow `givenNames` to de provided as either a space separated values string or as an array of strings.

```yaml
title: Person
...
properties:
  ...
  givenNames:
    ...
    anyOf:
      - codec: ssi
      - type: array
        items:
          type: strings
```

## Writing `<type>.md` documentation files

Documentation for a schema is written in a markdown file, named to match the corresponding schema. For example, `schema/Link.schema.yaml` is documented in `schema/Link.md`. For the rest of this document we will refer to the `Link` schema but this should be replaced with the name of whatever schema you are creating.

Each documentation file should contain a title, list of authors, schema property documentation table and some examples of the content. Much of this can be automatically generated with `encoda` once an empty documentation Markdown file has been created, and there are some standard text that can just be included into the file.

### Generating skeleton

A Markdown file containing a table of the schema properties for your new schema can be generated by running `npm run docs:build`. Then, you can create a markdown file next to the schema (i.e. `schema/<type>.md`).

The public properties table can be included in the file with an `include` directive:

```markdown
include: ../public/<type>.schema.md
:::
:::
```

Process the file with `encoda` to fill in this table and generate the metadata heading.

```bash
$ npx encoda process schema/<type>.md
```

You can now complete the `title` (it should match the `<type>`) and `authors` section.

### Intro Paragraph

The documentation should start with a level one header with the <type> and then a short description of how to use the
type.

### Examples

Following the introduction, include some examples of the implementation of this schema. With the use of `encoda` it is
possible to automatically generate these examples from a single implementation.

Start by creating a code block with the example in JSON format (this example will refer to the `Link.md` documentation).
Make sure the type is `json` and add `import=...` argument to name the code chunk as a variable.

```markdown
// extra spaces added between backticks for escaping, these are not necessary
`` `json import=ex1 { "type": "Link", "content": ["Stencila’s website"], "target": "https://stenci.la" }` ``
```

Now the code chunk can be referred to with the variable name given (in this case, `ex1`) with the `export` argument. To
convert to HTML, for example, just create a code chunk with the format and exported variable name:

```markdown
// extra spaces added between backticks for escaping, these are not necessary
`` `html export=ex1` ``
```

Now, run `encoda process` again:

```bash
$ npx encoda process schema/Link.md
```

And any exported code chunks should be automatically converted and included:

```markdown
// extra spaces added between backticks for escaping, these are not necessary
`` `html export=ex1 <a href="https://stenci.la">Stencila’s website</a>` ``
```

This can be done for most types supported by `encoda`. In some instances where full documents are generated (e.g. Docx
or ODF) you should instead export to a standalone file, like this:

```markdown
[`odt`](link-ex1.out.odt){export=ex1}
```

The file `link-ex1.out.odt` will be created.

#### Markdown Examples

When writing Markdown examples within a Markdown file, a sequence of three (n) backticks can be escaped by enclosing it four (n+1) backticks e.g.

    ````
    ```py
    a + 6 * b
    ```
    ````

### Example Metadata

Each example should include a little bit about what the element has been converted to. It is also good to include a
link to a definition of which element a schema encodes to. For example, for Markdown examples, link to an
[MDAST](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast) definition. For HTML definitions,
[developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/) is a good resource.

### Documentation Examples

The `schema/Link.md` and `schema/Delete.md` are good examples of documentation that can be referred to when writing your
own.

## Autogenerated Schema Bindings

We derive language binding files such as [types.ts](./ts/types.ts),
[types.py](./py/stencila/schema/types.py), and [types.R](./r/R/types.R) from
the [schema YAML files](./schema/).

Despite those files being auto-generated, there are a couple of reasons why it is useful to include them in this repository.

- Having them so that packages can be installed from the Git repo e.g.

```r
devtools::install_github("stencila/schema", subdir = "r", upgrade = "ask")
```

```bash
pip install -e git+https://github.com/stencila/schema.git#subdirectory=py
```

- Allows us to more easily compare changes to the bindings and potentially identify issues.

However, since these files are derived from the YAML files, there is
potential risk of the type bindings and schema YAML to drift out of sync.

One remedy we have in place is to use [git hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks).
This allows us to automatically build the schema, detects changes in the bindings, and commit them prior to each push command.

To see the exact steps being performed, please see the [`checkBindings`](./Makefile) command in the `Makefile`.

# Developing with Docker

If you don't want to install `npm` on your host directly, you can build the provided
`Dockerfile`:

```bash
make build-image
```

Then bind your local working directory and run commands from inside the container. For example, here is how we would run `make docs`

```bash
$ make run-image
# Now we are inside the container...
> make docs
```
